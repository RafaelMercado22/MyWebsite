The idea of the meme is to highlight the smurf cat's existence in nature, circling spots on the Earth, then on forests/nature, until it "zooms" in close enough to view the smurf cat in it's natural habitat.

The meme is paired with the song ![The Spectre]([YouTube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSt0ZMl4TVQ) by Alan Walker (Don't get it mixed up with "Spectre", Alan's intsrumental version and inspiration for this song), the lyrics go contained in the meme goes,"It all belongs to the other side, we live, we love, we lie."

Looking deeper into the song choice, it might entail that on the other side of nature belongs various creatures such as the Smurf Cat depicted.
